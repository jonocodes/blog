title: "Talk: How to Entertain a Juggler"
---
This is a presentation I seem to give every couple years. It can be 30 minutes to an hour depending on the venue, and if there is a hands on juggling lesson at the end.

In 2015 I went to see a friend do a presentation at  [Nerd Nite East Bay](https://www.facebook.com/NerdNiteEB/) about Native Bees. There were some other interesting talks and one was about competitive dodgeball leagues. The audience was very entertained with the idea that a kids playground game would be turned so seriously by adults.

I had been going to juggling festivals most of my life at this point and while watching the dodgeball talk, I thought this is pretty tame compared to [full contact combat juggling](https://www.thewjf.com/combat-juggling/) competitions. And combat is only one of dozens of other events one may find at a juggling festival.

So I started working on my own talk. But since combat is not really my jam, I focus on showing all the fun things jugglers like to do when they get together and are not focused on entertaining non-jugglers. And there is a LOT.
