_I wrote this piece for my friend [Emily Heller](https://emilyhellercomedy.com/) years back for her printed [zine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) called "A Sorry Book"._

Man, this wont make sense to anyone... unless ye be the old common computer nerd. So I am working in the school computer lab - its my fifth year here. This girl is moaning and groaning that she is having trouble with her account. So I say, "oh you just have to delete some old emails and stuff and you will be set". She says she does not know how to do it, so I'm like "move over rover, let Jono take over". So I sit down and blindly delete all the files in the folder she has open with a little "rm -fR \*" (delete everything without asking and there's no turning back). And then I realized that it was her main folder... the one that contains everything she owns, not just the emails that needed to be deleted. I just dumped her class work for every class, and all her emails, and whatever else she's got. I swallowed hard and gave her a serious look, "you are going to have to call tech support". She didn't realize what I had done, so I figured it best to pack my bags and hit the road. And so I did. Woops, hope you did not need that stuff. My bad. And while I am apologizing, sorry to those who spent time reading this and did not understand it at all.
