title: OWASP Security Workshop 2024
---
At [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) we had a two day workshop/game given a couple times a year for anyone who wanted to join. It was a fun way of introducing penetration testing to web application developers.

As a developer we may know to use the right database library that prevents things like an SQL injection, but do we really ever get to experience a real SQL injection?

So we review the [top 10 web vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), put on our hacker hats and practice penetration testing.

There is a great project called the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) that is a modern PHP web app, full of vulnerabilities. Even better, the app has an area that describes specific challenges and keep track of your progress.

I have adapted my own version of running this workshop. It's low overhead and can be done both as a group and individually self directed. I ran the workshop over a day with the development team while working at [Populus](https://www.populus.ai/). It went well and I got some valuable feedback. I plan to repeat this tradition at future workplaces and will continue to refine it each time.

If you have it in you, running this workshop is a blast. [You can follow my instructions here](/docs/pen-testing-game-day/). Let me know how it goes.
