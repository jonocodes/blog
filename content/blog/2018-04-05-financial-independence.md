title: "Talk: Financial Independence"
---
In 2018, my buddy [Jory John](http://www.joryjohn.com/) was nudging me to [read](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) and [listen](https://choosefi.com/listen) to some personal finance stuff that was going around. I enjoyed it, and it was a wake up call for me to get my ducks in order.

I made plans to aggressively pay off our debts, learned how to methodically save, consolidated my accounts, and figured out index fund investing for retirement (which I had always felt daunted by).

After enthusiastically talking with friends about my findings and recommending books, my co-worked suggested I make a brown bag talk about it for the office. [Slides](https://jonocodes.github.io/whyfi/static/index.html#/) and [source](https://github.com/jonocodes/whyfi?tab=readme-ov-file) here.

This is not the favorite of my talks, but I have given it several times. These day when I present it, I like to focus on [credit card churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/) - since it can be fun and people always have the most questions about it. Its a little more enjoyable then giving blanket financial advice like: Dont buy that Starbucks coffee every morning. Instead you could invest that spending and become a millionaire by the time you are 40.

These days when someone wants to dip their tow in financial independence, I suggest reading [The Simple Path To Wealth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30646587-the-simple-path-to-wealth).
