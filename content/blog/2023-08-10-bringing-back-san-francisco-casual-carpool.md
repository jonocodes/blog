title: Bringing Back San Francisco Casual Carpool
---
I have been trying to bring back SF casual carpool since it ended with the pandemic. Here are some of the things I/we have done between September 2022 and August 2023.

### Things I have tried

- Waiting at the North Berkeley passenger line daily, using both [sfcarpool.app](http://sfcarpool.app) and the [RapidCarpool](https://rapidcarpool.com/) app
    - I have done this for close to a year, waiting 20 minutes a day. I get picked up around once a month.
- Created [SFcarpool.app](http://SFcarpool.app) for helping people coordinate carpools

- Reached out to existing [carpool web sites](https://ridenow.org/carpool/discussion.html)
- Handing out [flyers at North Berkeley BART](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPvqR0_lNU-az14bWNEczinnv-THPdeeWqLz62zsdKw/edit?usp=sharing)
    - This suggested with coordinated start date. BART riders showed interest, but there was no uptick in carpooling. I did this for about a month in late 2022.
- [Created outreach survey](https://sfcarpool.app/survey)
- [Created a Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bringbacksfcarpool)
- [Post](https://nextdoor.com/p/mqMwzXJqrjTK?view=detail) to other social media, like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/yc46lb/casual_carpool_in_2022/jrcff21/?context=3) and [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/p/dQJpxCTN6SmZ/c/846265547?post=241417236&comment=846265547&ct=pdXr03-vsiKf6ALGoGfMif2Va68MPE83Hrb77iEEcki2N3JNt6ytnWqJLzW7oL8Y&ec=jUsXRsKkOPMVxJBs1Cj9scCEDVfj1pLaDEEEO8rW-uw%3D).
- News outlet outreach
    - I reached out to reporters who wrote about carpool in the last couple years. At [KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/11934347/will-casual-carpool-ever-come-back), [Berkeleyside](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2022/11/20/casual-carpool-bay-bridge-covid-traffi), Chronicle
- Reached out to the city of Berkeley to talk about help/solutions. No responses.
- Reached out to the city of Oakland to talk about help/solutions. No responses.
- [TV interview on ABC 7](https://abc7news.com/bay-area-casual-carpool-commuting-bart-freeways/13559738/)

- Reached out to officials at MTC and SFMTA to see if we can get historical data for bridge exits to see if there has been a dip in exits at carpool drop sites. No response.
- [MTC blog post](https://blog.bayareametro.gov/posts/survey-seeks-bay-area-casual-carpool-revival)
- KQED interview (recording forthcoming)

### Things I have not yet tried

- Op-ed. It has been suggested I submit one to the Chronicle. And/or The East Bay Times, Berkeleyside, Daily Cal, Radio Perspective (KQED Radio)
- Bay Curious podcast
- Reach out to other casual carpool groups like Huston and DC.
- Contact Caltrans to see if they have highway exit data.
- Online date coordination
    - I flyered at BART with a start date to build a critical mass. But we could do a more effective version of this by polling people online and seeing who wants to commit to a date.
- Posting physical flyers with various web addresses at BART stations.
- Reviewing [previous research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292208482_Casual_Carpooling_in_The_San_Francisco_Bay_Area_Understanding_User_Characteristics_Behaviors_and_Motivations).
