title: "Talk: Computer Keyboards!"
---
I'm a keyboard nerd. I think if you are spending most of your days sitting at a desk, you may as well make it nice.

For me, its all about ergonomic [forms](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/) and [layouts](https://colemak.com/), but in this talk I get into the world of keyboard styling, meetups, hacking, competitions, and history. Its a very visual talk and somehow I managed to deliver these ~120 slides in 1 hour.

[Slides](https://jonocodes.github.io/awesome-keyboards) and [source](https://github.com/jonocodes/awesome-keyboards) here.

Key takeaways from the talk:
- Thumb clusters are awesome.
- QWERTY is an outdated convention.
- Keyboard customization can be a (fun) rabbit hole.
