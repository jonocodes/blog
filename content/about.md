# About

A while back I was looking for a blog post I wrote over a decade ago for my employer's tech blog. The site had long since been taken down. I found the wayback machine had some references to it, but not the actual content. 

[The internet is forever. But also, it isnâ€™t](https://www.theverge.com/24321569/internet-decay-link-rot-web-archive-deleted-culture?utm_source=pocket_shared). I don't need my stuff to live forever. but I would at least like to have copies of it for myself - mostly because its information I don't want to forget. So this site, mostly for myself.

Also, it was fun scrounging through my stuff to read about the ridiculous projects I spent time on and unpopular opinions I have had over the years. But as time goes on I will be sure do catalog more thoughts and bad ideas.
